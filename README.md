1. Project Title: Developed an "NLP Ham or Spam Classifier" to identify and classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham).  
2. Data Handling: Processed a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages using text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, removal of punctuation, stop words elimination, and feature extraction.  
3. Feature Engineering: Implemented Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text vectorization.  
4. Model Development: Built and trained a spam detection model using the Naive Bayes algorithm with a 96% accuracy score.  
5. Pipeline Automation: Designed an end-to-end pipeline combining text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification for streamlined predictions.  
6. Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize message length distributions and explore potential features for classification.  
7. Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and support, achieving strong performance in both spam and ham detection.  
8. Tools and Libraries: Proficient in Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
